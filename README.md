# Code samples from Lucene in Action 2nd Edition, rewritten in F#

These are code samples from the book [Lucene in Action 2nd Edition](https://www.manning.com/books/lucene-in-action-second-edition), but rewritten in 
[F#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/what-is-fsharp).

I'm using the latest version of [Lucene.NET](https://lucenenet.apache.org/), which at this time is `4.8.0-beta00016`.
